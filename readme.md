# Free Inference Speed Gain with ONNX <!-- omit in toc -->

ONNX Runtime is a cross-platform inference and training machine-learning accelerator. [Learn more about it here.](https://onnx.ai/)

This repo demonstrates how converting a model saved in `H5` format to `.onnx` for a free speed gain. The model used is a simple neural network trained on [fashion_mnist dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/datasets/fashion_mnist/load_data).
